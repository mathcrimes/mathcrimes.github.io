title: First!

This is the first post in what I hope will be an exploration of some of my beliefs. I use the first person pronoun only in a very loose sense, to conform to a socialized, ego-centric manner of speaking. I wish to begin this exploration with a rejection of this ego-self. The sentences that follow should not be considered as coming from any single definable source, but rather are expressions of memes which exist in a sort of ecosystem inhabiting this body. I wish to explore how this idea of the self informs our view of ethics and the future of humanity.
