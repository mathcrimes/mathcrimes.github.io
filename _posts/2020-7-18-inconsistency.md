title: inconsistency
---

I said I would set out to explore some of my beliefs (subject to certain caveats about the self). I will say here that I have no expectation that these beliefs will be consistent with one another. I believe the analogy of an ecosystem of memes most clearly expresses the symbiosis of these beliefs, whether mutualism, competition, or even predation. I think inconsistency is not only acceptable, but inevitable. There is a wonderful essay by logician Raymond Smullyan called "Logicians who reason about themselves", [which you can find here](http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1029818&type=pdf&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=44077077&CFTOKEN=65318791), which illustrates the logical issues of rational entities reasoning about their own consistency quite nicely, and ties it in with Godel's famous theorems.

Our human inconsistency is perhaps a bit more mundane, though. Our beliefs usually come from experiences, which gives them a context. A context is a bit like a habitat for a meme. Beliefs with different contexts, though perhaps contradictory, often have not had the occasion to interact with one another. Most people don't go examining all of their beliefs looking for inconsistencies, although some do. When one experiences a sudden unexpected inconsistency, that is the delightfully human feeling of cognitive dissonance.
